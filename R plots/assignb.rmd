## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



##Data vizualization
ggplot2::mpg

#dataset description
?mpg


install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

#Making  a scatter plot of class vs. drv
ggplot(data=mpg)+
   geom_point(mapping = aes(x =class , y = drv))
   
#why is the plot not userful?
# The plot is not useful beacuse the scatter plot has less plot to make comparison between the type of drive train and the type of car since the class and the drv are both categorical variables and they carry a small number of values.
