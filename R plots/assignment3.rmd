## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Assignment


#1.What’s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
  
#The points are not blue because the color is assigned as blue which is interpreted as a categorical variable and it take only a single variable which is blue in this case.



#2.Which variables in mpg are categorical? Which variables are continuous? (Hint: type ?mpg to read the documentation for the dataset). How can you see this information when you run mpg?

#categorical variable- the value is limited and usually based on a particular finite group.

#continous variables- can take any values, from integer to decimal

?mpg
ggplot2::mpg

#hence:
#categorial variables include:

#manufacturer
#model
#trans
#drv
#fl
#class

# the variables are categorical beacuse because they are based on particular groups and are of the <chr> datatype.

#continous variables include:

#displ
#year
#cyl
#cty
#hwy

#the variables are continous because they take partcular values for example displ takes decimals and <dbl> datatpe while hwy takes interger values <int>.


#3.Map a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?

#size in continous variables

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = year))
  
#the sizes of the points vary continuously as according to their sizes e.g from small to large.

#color
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = cyl)) +
  geom_point()
  
# the continuous variable uses a scale that varies from a light to dark blue color. It reads from 4..to 8.

#shape
ggplot(data=mpg)+
   geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ, y=hwy,shape=cty))

#When a continuous value is mapped to shape, there is an error occurance beacuse shapes have no particular order for data analysis.
#but we can also map class to the shape aesthetic, which controls the shape of the points.


#4.What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?  

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = hwy, size = displ)) +
  geom_point()  
  
#the displ is mapped to both the x-axis and size while the hwy is mapped to the y-axis and the the color. The code runs by producing plots which are closely attached which doesn't make it easy to make a comparison.


#5.What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: use ?geom_point)

#Stroke changes the size of the border for shapes
#the shape range from(21 to 25)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
  geom_point(shape = 22, colour = "blue", fill = "white", size = 4,stroke=3)


#6.What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like aes(colour = displ < 5)? Note, you’ll also need to specify x and y.

#soln
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = displ < 5)) +
  geom_point()
  
#displ < 5 is a logical variable which takes values of TRUE or FALSE where a unique color is assign to each .


#7.What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?
#facet are  useful for categorical variables,
#split your plot into facets, subplots that each #display one subset of the data.
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(~ cyl)
  
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(~ cty)
  
#for the second code the plots contain a facet for each and every value
#the continous variables are changed to categorical variables.


#8. What do the empty cells in plot with facet_grid(drv ~ cyl) mean? How do they relate to this plot?


ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))


#the empty cells indicate the plots which have no points hence no observation is made when the drv and the cyl are combined.


#9.What plots does the following code make? What does . Do?

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ .)
  
#the code has(.)- drv ~ . facet by values of drv on the y-axis.

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
  
#  . ~ cyl will facet by values of cyl on the x-axis.


#9.Take the first faceted plot in this section:

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)


#What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset?

 
#10.Read ?facet_wrap. What does nrow do? What does ncol do? What other options control the layout of the individual panels? Why doesn’t facet_grid() have nrow and ncol arguments?

#facets are set of variables quoted by vars() and defining faceting groups on the rows or columns dimension.

#the nrow-determines the number of rows (columns) to use when laying out the facets.

#ncol-determines the number of columns.

#the face_grid()doesn't have nrow and ncol arguments because since the number of unique values of the variables specified in the function determines the number of rows and columns.


#11.When using facet_grid() you should usually put the variable with more unique levels in the columns. Why?

#when putting the more levels on the row axis,then the y_axis would shrink so  that it is harder to see which actual values are the points .


#12.What geom would you use to draw a line chart? A boxplot? A histogram? An area chart?

#linechart- geom_line()
#A boxplot- geom_boxplot()
#Ahistogram- geom_histogram()
#An area chart- geom_area


#13.Run this code in your head and predict what the output will look like. Then, run the code in R and check your predictions.

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)

#This code runs and its output is  a scatter plot with displ on the x-axis, hwy on the y-axis, and the points colored by drv. There is a smooth line, without standard errors, fit through each drv group.


#14.What does show.legend = FALSE do? What happens if you remove it?
#Why do you think I used it earlier in the chapter?

#the show.legend makes the scale not to have any legend for the aesthetic where it is included.

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point() 

#if it were removed, the legend appears on the scale because its default value is TRUE.

#15.What does the se argument to geom_smooth() do?
# the se display confidence interval around smooth
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
  
#16. Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
  
#the graphs are the same because the geom_point of the x and y axis data of both the graphs are same.  


#17. Recreate the R code necessary to generate the following graphs.
#a)
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
  
#b)
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(group = drv), se = FALSE) +
  geom_point()
  
#c) 
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
  
#d)
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = drv)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)

#c)
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ , y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = drv)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(linetype = drv), se = FALSE)
  
#d)
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(size = 4, color = "white") +
  geom_point(aes(colour = drv))
  
#18)
#What is the default geom associated with stat_summary()? How could you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the stat function?

ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_pointrange(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    stat = "summary"
  )
  
 
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_pointrange(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    stat = "summary",
    fun.min = min,
    fun.max = max,
    fun = median
  )  
  
#19)

#What is the problem with this plot? How could you improve it?

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()


#There are many plots between the cty and hwy. It could be improve by using jitter position which shows the location of the plots

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(position = "jitter")
  
#20)
#What parameters to geom_jitter() control the amount of jittering?

#Width parameter controls the amount of horizontal displacement.
#Height parameter controls the amount of vertical displacement.

#21)
#Compare and contrast geom_jitter() with geom_count().

#The geom_jitter() method reduces overplotting since two points with the same location are unlikely to have the same random variation.


ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(position = "jitter")

#22.The geom_count() sizes the points relative to the number of observations.

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_count()


#23.What’s the default position adjustment for geom_boxplot()? Create a visualization of the mpg dataset that demonstrates it.

#The default position for geom_boxplot() is position_dodge2

ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = drv, y = hwy, colour = class)) +
  geom_boxplot()
  
  
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = drv, y = hwy, colour = class)) +
  geom_boxplot(position = "identity")
